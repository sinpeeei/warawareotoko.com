I think that begun yesterday.Sundunly floated the word"sukekiyo".

Sukekiyo is the band which is thougth that it is kyo's solo project by TORIKO,and he stands inside in that photo is Kyo from DIR RN GREY. 
 Forward,I edited the topics from twitter.

First,suddenly COUNT DOWN JPAN which is the japanese music event publisged on home page.

Secondly,SUGIZO feat LUNASEA invited sukekiyo for his opening act at his live at shibuya in 15th November.

Thirdly,Sukekiyo photo is looked like Kyo from dir engrey.

This is it.So I think it must be Kyo exactly. 

So I formed it with Photoshop to make to be light.
But this photo is covered by Black shape　purposely.

Othoer members are slender and tall. One of them is looked like Kaoru from DIR EN GREY.

Is sitting member Toshiya?But his hair is not long now.

So, I got to be very useful information. The copyright of Official site is marked "Sun-krad".
"Sun-krad" is management office of DIR EN GREY.
